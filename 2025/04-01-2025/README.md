# Week 13 (April 1, 2025) - Pokemon Power Evolution

Data Source: TidyTuesday Pokemon Dataset | Libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, ggtext, showtext

## üéØ The Story

Pokemon power evolution reveals an interesting trend: while legendary Pokemon drove most of the power growth from Generation 1 to Generation 4, regular Pokemon have been steadily catching up. From Gen 4 to Gen 7, overall power levels remained stable even as legendary power decreased, suggesting that regular Pokemon are closing the gap.

## üí° Key Insights

- Generation 1 (1996) had the lowest overall power levels with regular Pokemon averaging around 400 base stats
- Generation 4 (2007) saw the biggest power jump, driven primarily by legendary Pokemon reaching ~600+ base stats
- Generation 7 (2016) shows power convergence - legendary power decreased while regular Pokemon power increased
- The gap between regular and legendary Pokemon is narrowing, suggesting better game balance over time
