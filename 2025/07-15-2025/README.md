Dataset: British Library Funding (1998-2023) | Focus: Government dependency analysis and strategic funding trends

üîó Dataset Source

- GitHub: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-07-15/bl_funding.csv
- Source: British Library Annual Reports 1998-2023
- Data Type: Financial time series with funding breakdown by source

üéØ Key Insights & Findings

- Government Grant-in-Aid consistently provides 65-85% of total funding (25-year average: 74.2%)
- 2006 anomaly: Lowest government dependency (64.5%) due to exceptional ¬£32M voluntary donations
- Funding strategy demonstrates optimal balance: stable government support + strategic philanthropy
- 2020 data confirms resilience: ¬£125.9M total funding with 86% government dependency during COVID

üìà Data Analysis Approach

- Focus: Government dependency trends over 25 years (1998-2023)
- Visualization: Line plot with highlighted anomalies and strategic annotations
- Statistical insight: Identified 2006 as outlier due to exceptional voluntary income

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- Libraries: tidyverse, ggplot2, ggtext, showtext, scales
- Typography: Google Fonts (Roboto family) for professional appearance
- Color Palette: Professional blue (#2E4057) with dark red accent (#C73E1D) for anomalies
- Output: High-resolution PNG (300 DPI, 14x9 inches) suitable for publication

üìä Historical Context & Research Insights

- 2006 coincided with Business & IP Centre opening and British Library Sounds launch
- Financial crisis (2008-2012) showed funding resilience with minimal government cuts
- Post-2015 stabilization reflects mature funding strategy balancing public/private sources

üî¢ Data Summary & Methodology

- Time Period: 25 years (1998-2023) - complete dataset, no missing years
- Government Dependency Range: 64.5% (2006) to 86.3% (2020)
- 2006 Breakdown: ¬£159.2M total (¬£102.6M gov + ¬£31.9M voluntary + ¬£22.8M services)
- Design Philosophy: Clean, minimal annotation highlighting single key insight

üéÜ GitHub Repository Description

**TidyTuesday Week 28: British Library Funding Stability Analysis**

Exploring 25 years of British Library funding data reveals remarkable institutional resilience. This analysis focuses on government dependency trends, uncovering how strategic philanthropy enhances rather than replaces stable public investment.

**Key Discovery:** The 2006 'funding dip' represents a success story - exceptional ¬£32M in voluntary donations temporarily reduced government dependency while enabling major digital initiatives.

**Technical Approach:** Clean R visualization using ggplot2 with strategic color coding to highlight anomalies. Professional typography and minimal design philosophy prioritize data story over decoration.

**Files:** R script, high-res PNG output
