## üéØ Project Overview

**The Story:** From a single groundbreaking 2004 study to a field that now provides rapid climate analysis within days of extreme weather events, attribution science has become essential infrastructure for understanding our changing climate.

**Key Insight:** What started as experimental research exploded around 2010 due to improved computational methods and increasing extreme events, then gained institutional support in 2014 with the founding of World Weather Attribution.

## üìä The Visualization

### **Main Finding**

The rise of climate attribution science shows two critical inflection points:

- **2010**: Technical breakthrough enabling rapid acceleration
- **2014**: Institutional breakthrough with World Weather Attribution

### **Why This Matters**

This isn't just academic growth‚Äîit's the evolution of science that now influences:

- **Emergency planning** during disasters
- **Insurance decisions** worth billions
- **Climate litigation** in courts worldwide
- **Government policy** on climate adaptation

## üîç Key Insights

### The Timeline

- **2004**: First attribution study linked climate change to Europe's deadly heatwave
- **2010**: "Real acceleration began as computational methods improved and extreme events became more frequent"
- **2014**: World Weather Attribution founded for rapid-response studies
- **Present**: Mature operational science providing evidence for real-world decisions

### The Impact

According to research from World Weather Attribution and Carbon Brief:

- **Over 600 studies** have analyzed 735+ extreme events globally
- **70% of extreme weather events** studied show evidence of climate change influence
- **92% of heat studies** find climate change made events more likely/severe
- **65% of drought studies** and **58% of rainfall studies** show climate influence

### The Revolution

Attribution science transformed from asking *"Is climate change real?"* to quantifying exactly *"How much did climate change intensify this specific disaster?"*

## üí° The Compelling Narrative

**From Tragedy to Understanding:**

In 2003, a devastating heatwave killed over 70,000 people across Europe. For the first time, scientists asked: *"What was climate change's role in this tragedy?"* The groundbreaking 2004 study that answered this question‚Äîfinding climate change had at least doubled the heatwave's risk‚Äîlaunched the entire field of extreme event attribution.

The real acceleration began around 2010, as computational methods improved and extreme events became more frequent. The field reached a turning point in 2014, when World Weather Attribution was founded to provide rapid-response attribution studies. The following year saw a major European heatwave, demonstrating the power of this new rapid attribution science.

Today, attribution science has transformed from experimental research into an operational tool used by governments, insurance companies, and courts. Each study adds crucial evidence to the mounting case that our changing climate is reshaping the extreme weather affecting billions worldwide.
